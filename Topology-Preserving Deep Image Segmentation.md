## 2.1 Topology and Persistent Homology

d-dimension topological structure: homology class, equivalence class of d-manifolds.

* 0-dim manifold: connected components
* 1-dim manifold: handles (closed loops) (locally a line)
* 2-dim manifold: non intersecting closed surfaces (locally a plane)

### [Topology refresher](https://bjlkeng.github.io/posts/manifolds/)
A n-dim topological manifold M has a countable base locally homeomorphic to Rn (eg sphere is locally plane). For every point p in M there is an open neighbourhood U of p and an homeomorphism phi:U-Z onto an open subset V of Rn.

phi: chart or coordinate system.
a set of chart phia with domanis Ua is called an atlas of M if union of all Ua = M.
